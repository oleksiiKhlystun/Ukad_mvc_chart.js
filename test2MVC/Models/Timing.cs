Test task for NET developer position

Story
As user I want a tool for evaluating website performance.

Acceptance criteria
 It should be a web site, ASP.NET MVC(suggestion: you can use
bootstrap framework)
 It should be a page with text box where user can enter URL
 Application has to determine sitemap of requested URL, sends requests
to sitemap’s URLs and measure response time.
 Test result should display pages speed graphically (top of the page)
 Test result should display page speed as a table(bottom of the page).
Table should contain min and max values for each page
 Slowest requests should be on top
 It should be possible to evaluate tests result history for tested web sites
 Source code for the task should be uploaded to GitHub or Bitbucket

Notes
Approach, tools, database engine can be selected by candidate.
It would be super cool in case response time is showed in real time.However
it is not required.
